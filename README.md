All detailed responses are contained in [GluConv Response Letter](./GluConv_Response_Letter.pdf).

The planed resubmission version is [GluConv Resubmission](./GluConv_Resubmission.pdf).

The confirmation of the outlier of XGBoost is contained in [outlier of XGBoost](./outlier_xgboost_weinstock.txt). The average time can be found by `Ctrl+F: Average Training Time`in this file.

🙏 Hope GluConv can be offered a chance to see a wider range of readers.

## 🌟 GluConv: Convincing, Convolutional, Convenient

# 🏆 Contributions

**Efficient UNets:** We propose two efficient UNet algorithms based on convolutions for temporal dependencies and variate correlations: Time Channel Block and Variate Channel Block. The architecture optimizes the fusion of both global and local features at multi-scales.

**GluConv \& Performance Superiority** Based on previous blocks, we propose GluConv and extensive experiments demonstrate that GluConv has superiority over benchmarks. GluConv is deemed as a **Conv**incing, **Conv**olutional, and **Conv**enient  model in terms of accuracy, trustworthiness, responsiveness, robustness.
